# uniQconsulting ag
I am working for uniQconsulting ag and the initial roles I have written in my free time to prepare for Red Hat Ansible exam.
When uniQconsulting ag started to work more and more with Ansible, I moved this roles into the uniQconsulting github namespace.
However, to better suit my needs, I dediced to take them back and maintain my own, independent and more flexible version of it.
Feel free to use, discuss and make some pull requests if you feel the need.

Thanks

Chris
